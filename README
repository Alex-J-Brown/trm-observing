trm.observing is a minimal package that is mainly about one script,
"eplanner.py" along with a more recent addition "parallactic.py".
It requires trm.subs and astropy to be available along with stuff
that any decent python installation will have such as numpy and
matplotlib.

"eplanner.py" provides a visual representation of the times of eclipses
and visibility periods of multiple targets. 

"parallactic.py" computes the parallactic angle of a given RA and Dec
for an offset relative to the current time. Useful for spectroscopy.
Installation is the usual

  python setup.py install --prefix=<installation directory>

or

  python setup.py install --user

with the last part optional if you are root. 

Only python3 is supported.
