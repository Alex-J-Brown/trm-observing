trm.observing is a minimal package that is all about one script,
"eplanner.py". It requires trm.subs and trm.sla to be available.

eplanner provides a visual representation of the times of eclipses
and visibility periods of multiple targets. 

Installation is the usual

python setup.py install --prefix=<installation directory>

with the last part optional if you are root.
