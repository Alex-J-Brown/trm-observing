trm.observing is a minimal package that is all about one script,
"eplanner.py". It requires trm.subs to be available and used astropy
and matplotlib. 

eplanner provides a visual representation of the times of eclipses
and visibility periods of multiple targets. 

Installation is the usual

python setup.py install --prefix=<installation directory>

with the last part optional if you are root.

2017-04-30: has undergone extensive changes which will only work under python3
and now require astropy and matplotlib rather than sla and pgplot.
