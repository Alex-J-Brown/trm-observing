This contains three example files for eplanner.

targets.lis -- some positions and ephemerides of stars.
targets.prg -- some critical phase ranges of interest.
targets.swi -- an example switch file

Then the commands:

eplanner.py targets.lis TNT targets.prg 2015-01-20

eplanner.py targets.lis TNT targets.prg 2015-01-20 -s targets.swi

should make plots of the observable times for each star, particular phases,
when they are close to the meridian, when they pass behind the aerial (in the
case of the Doi Inthanon telescope). The switch file allows you to overplot an
observational plan for the night.

Type 'eplanner -h' for a list of the available options.
